            Mentors play a pivotal role at OSL, offering their expertise to
            guide interns through data science projects. Experienced data
            scientists are invited to contribute by providing project ideas,
            supervising project development, and refining proposals with interns.
            This collaboration not only enhances the learning experience but also
            drives innovation within the data science community.
        </p>
        <p class="py-2 m-0">
            Mentors can also submit their own data science projects, using open
            data, for intern contributions, creating a dynamic environment for
            practical learning and development.

        <h2 class="text-center mb-4">Internship Opportunities</h2>
        <p class="py-2 m-0">
          OSL Data Science Interns engage in hands-on projects that apply
          data science techniques to solve real-world problems.
        </p>
        <p class="py-2 m-0">
          Candidates should prepare a project proposal, either for an
          existing project or a new idea using open data, and collaborate
          with a mentor to refine their approach. Interns commit to at least
          <strong>20 hours per week</strong> for three months, working on
          projects that will be showcased on our dedicated platform and GitHub.
        </p>
        <p class="py-2 m-0">
          This rigorous experience is bolstered by comprehensive mentor
          support, culminating in a certificate of completion in partnership with
          <a href="https://thegraphnetwork.org">The GRAPH network</a> and
          <a href="https://datateller.org">DataTeller</a>, provided the
          project meets the set standards.
        </p>
        <p class="py-2 m-0">
          The first step in this journey is to contact a mentor. Check their
          availability and discuss which projects you might contribute to.
          The mentor can then suggest a project idea for you to start with,
          or help you with your specific data science project!
        </p>
        <p><strong>Note: all the projects should be open source, and use open data.</strong></p>
