# Mentors

Mentors play a pivotal role at OSL, offering their expertise to guide interns
through data science projects. Experienced data scientists are invited to
contribute by providing project ideas, supervising project development, and
refining proposals with interns. This collaboration not only enhances the
learning experience but also drives innovation within the data science
community.

Mentors can also submit their own data science projects, using open data, for
intern contributions, creating a dynamic environment for practical learning and
development.

If you want to be a mentor or propose your Data Science project to be included
to the included to our Data Science Internship program, please send an email to
<team@opensciencelabs.org>.
